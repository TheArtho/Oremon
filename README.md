# Oremon â€“ Minecraft Bedrock Addon (Gen 1â€“7)

**Oremon** is an open-source Minecraft Bedrock Behavior Pack written in **TypeScript**, bringing a modular PokÃ©mon-inspired experience to Bedrock Edition. It aims to include full data support for all official PokÃ©mon from **Generation 1 to Generation 8**.

> Inspired by the PokÃ©mon franchise and powered by the latest Bedrock Scripting API (`@minecraft/server 2.0.0-beta`).

## Current Features

- Includes every PokÃ©mon data from Gen 1 to Gen 7 (800+)
- TypeScript-based scripting for safe, maintainable code
- NodeJS environment for automated compilation and deployment
- Clean and type-safe `OremonData` interface structure
- i18n support with multiple language files (names, descriptions, etc.)
- Autogenerated data using **veekun's PokÃ©mon database** in SQLite + scripts
